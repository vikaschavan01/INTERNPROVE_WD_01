        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>Consider adding a checkbox and an "I Agree" statement along with the link to your Terms so you can get users to clearly agree to them.

            This is known as clickwrap and it is a popular way of assuring acceptance of agreements with web sites and apps. It works well for these purposes too if you allow people to purchase your product or service online.</p>
